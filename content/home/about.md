# About

My industry experience dedicates to building capacity, solving problems and making it easier for organizations/program teams to engage with data for evidence routinely. By integrating my background in health information, public health and informatics, my mission is to democratize data use and amplify knowledge discovery at scale for evidence.

I am an active contributor to the DHIS2 community and an advanced user of R. I am not afraid to ask for help from other sources and not to try and solve problems which are far beyond my core skillsets. I believe that my global experience combined with a broad set of technical competencies have helped my clients to better achieve their goals often in difficult settings. I am the co-founder of Focal Analytics Group Ltd.
