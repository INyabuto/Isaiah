# About

I am a Management Information System (MIS) consultant at PSI. I support country teams in East Africa to manage the PSI MIS better and to engage with data for evidence. Previously, I was helping the GIZ Health Sector program data use project in Kenya where I was majorly involved at setting up a training database and co-facilitating sessions on scorecards. 

I am an advanced user of R and I got a background in health information and informatics. My mission is to democratize health information systems and amplify knowledge discovery at scale for public health evidence.

I am not afraid to ask for help from other sources and not to try and solve problems which are far beyond my core skill sets. I believe that my global experience combined with a broad set of technical competencies have helped my clients to better achieve their goals often under challenging settings.
