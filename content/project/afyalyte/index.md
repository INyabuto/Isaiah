AfyaLyte, initially a team dedicated to building analytics platform that leverage on GIS and data science technologies in mapping of health events at the HIGDA 2017 Hackathon in JKUAT. AfyaLyte stands in the gap of the lagging capacity in the analysis of the health sector performance in implementing a comprehensive M&amp;E and the unmet information  needs of health managers and the sector as a whole.

Our use case was on using GIS to monitor and evaluate immunisation program. We pulled organisation unit data and immunisation data elements from the dhis2 visualised it on a map with different analytical presentations. Public health planners can used our platform to collate, analyze and gather insights for evidence in immunization programs.
