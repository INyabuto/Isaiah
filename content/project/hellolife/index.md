A data analytics dashboard that models and predicts the performance of organisation units based on antenatal care (ANC) coverage and pregnancy related complications. 

The project explored the capabilities of DHIS2 analytics, identified limitations and developed scalable solutions as part of the capstone project for HIGDA 2017 Bootcamp. Key features of the app include; the ability to compare data elements to discover associations, plot multiple plots on the same page and download reports, evaluate and predict trends of progress indicators and visualise data on map. 

Hello Life is meant to exist and to support the Kenyaâ€™s health vision for a technology platform that is able to monitor key progress indicators for improved evidenced based decision making and resource allocations by strengthening the sector to act as resource.
