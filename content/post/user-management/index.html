<p>Managing a bunch of users directly in DHIS2 is not something you would like to do on a late friday afternoon. It gets even worse, when the system is fairly unstable and all what you see is <strong>502 - bad gate way</strong>. Its the time to shutdown the laptop and head straight home! In this post, I am going to share a mini guide on how to quickly manage users, maximize on the DHIS2 up time (accomplish much with less time), and keep your friday afternoon in the mood!</p>
<p>Before you start, I recommend reading the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.dhis2.org/2.30/en/developer/html/dhis2_developer_manual_full.html#webapi_users">DHIS2 developers guide</a></li>
<li>PSI DHIS2 Standards</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.dhis2.org/master/en/developer/html/rsetup.html">DHIS2 and R Integration</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, to follow along with me: Please set up R and RStudio. See here on how to get started with R programming.</p>
