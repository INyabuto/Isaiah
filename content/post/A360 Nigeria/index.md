summary = "During a recent visit to Nigeria, PSI’s Evidence and GBS worked with the Adolescents 360 team to prepare for the implementation of DHIS2 as the project’s primary monitoring system. Up until now, the A360 project has relied on inefficient Excel-based tools to collect, compile and access routine monitoring data, leading to quality issues and low levels of data use. Team members were trained on the use of smartphones, DHIS2 forms and techniques to collect and manage data efficiently using the new DHIS2 Android Capture app. The new data collection process will be guided by detailed SOPs that outline the roles and responsibilities throughout the data flow process, ensuring that adequate quality assurance mechanisms and procedures are in place. Following a pilot phase, the team is expected to go live with DHIS2 on June 1st."

<b>Adolescents 360 in Nigeria to go live with DHIS2 Android Capture</b>

Our A360 project in Nigeria provides youth-friendly reproductive health services through a network of trained providers, combining life skills building for adolescent girls and young women with the uptake of modern contraception. Up to now, the A360 project in Nigeria has been relying on inefficient tools to collect, compile and provide access to routine monitoring data on social mobilization, referral and attendance rates, and service provision. This has included compiling data locally and merging and uploading spreadsheets on SharePoint for easy access. Despite multiple attempts to improve the timeliness and other quality standards, data quality has consistently remained a problem.

During a 7-day visit (March 26 - April 4, 2019) by PSI’s Evidence and GBS teams to the SFH offices in Abuja, the A360 team were trained on the use of smartphones, DHIS2 forms and new techniques to collect and manage data efficiently using the platform. At the same time, with support from the central A360 team, the data flow process and data quality assurance mechanisms were further improved. We visited one of the A360 youth-friendly clinics to meet with field staff (mobilizers, providers, quality assurance staff and supervisors), during which we further refined the data model and procedures.

The updated approach was documented and shared with project staff as new standard operating procedures, along with a manual for using the DHIS2 Android Capture app and the A360 forms. The central A360 team in Abuja was also given a crash course on basic system administration: managing organization units, user accounts, and basic troubleshooting.

<b>New approach</b>

Data will be collected directly by field staff using the DHIS2 Android Capture app: mobilizers, mentors and providers will submit records on a daily basis through DHIS2 event programs on a mobile device (Nokia smartphones). The DHIS2 forms were designed to minimize errors and guide the user through relevant sections, depending on the activity that is conducted with the client. Regional A360 staff will be responsible for initial data quality assurance, using the DHIS2 interactive dashboards that allow them to monitor daily progress.

The process will be guided by the detailed SOPs that outline the roles and responsibilities along the data flow process, ensuring that adequate quality assurance mechanisms and procedures are in place.

<b>Towards transition</b>

“Regional teams have cascaded down the training on DHIS2 mobile apps, and the team is set to begin six weeks of piloting,” says Anthony Ehon, Sr. A360 Research and Evaluation Manager for Nigeria, on a call.

Pending results from the pilot, a joint follow-up visit by Evidence and GBS is scheduled towards the end of May to assess the results of the pilot and to facilitate the live transition into DHIS2.
