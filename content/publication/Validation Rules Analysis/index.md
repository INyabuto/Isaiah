abstract = "Validation rule analysis tests validation rules against the data registered in the system. Validation violations are reported when the condition defined in the validation rule expression is not met, which means when the condition is false. For example, a validation rule could assert that *Suspected malaria cases tested* >= *Confirmed malaria cases* or that *Injectable 1 month quantities* = *Injectable 1 month clients* and in case the validation rule is not met, an Instruction is reported to the user."
