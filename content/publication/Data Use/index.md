abstract = "DHIS2 is a powerful, web-based and opensource platform that's used for data analysis and reporting for global health programs. As a leader and innovator of this platform, PSI extensively uses DHIS2 with its programs, incorporating the system's data collection and program monitoring capabilities into its own data for decision-making objectives. For PSI, building a strong culture of data use is essential to the success of its projects, and emphasizes this through its collaboration with the University of Oslo, the original creator of DHIS2, working together to greatly improve the platform and make it the best choice for Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). As the push for supplying data for evidence-based decision-making has grown, program managers are now struggling to face the higher demands for drawing insights from data. Much of the frustration is due to a limited capacity to engage with data and poor transparency on insights and action capabilities in DHIS2. Recognizing the issue, PSI designed a workshop that would meet the specific needs of their country teams, and was organized specifically under the direction of three global departments at PSI: The Global Evidence Department, Global Business Systems (GBS) and the Womenâ€™s Health Project Core Team."

Much of the frustration is due to the limited capacity to engage with data and poor transparency on the insights and associated action capabilities in DHIS2. This report examines this in details and explains how the Women Health Project (WHP) program teams were trained on how to effectively use and engage with data in DHIS2. "
