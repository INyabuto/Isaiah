abstract = "From the 14 â€“ 18th of May 2018, The Women's Health Project (WHP) program teams from four Population Services International (PSI) countries were trained at the WHP Data to Action workshop in Tanzania on how to effectively use and engage with data in DHIS2. DHIS2 is a powerful, web-based and opensource platform that's used for data analysis and reporting for global health programs."
abstract_short = "As the push for supplying data for evidence-based decision-making has grown, program managers are now struggling to face the higher demands for drawing insights from data. Much of the frustration is due to a limited capacity to engage with data and poor transparency on insights and action capabilities in DHIS2."
