abstract = "During a recent visit to Nigeria, PSI’s Evidence and GBS worked with the Adolescents 360 team to prepare for the implementation of DHIS2 as the project’s primary monitoring system. Up until now, the A360 project has relied on inefficient Excel-based tools to collect, compile and access routine monitoring data, leading to quality issues and low levels of data use. Team members were trained on the use of smartphones, DHIS2 forms and techniques to collect and manage data efficiently using the new DHIS2 Android Capture app. The new data collection process will be guided by detailed SOPs that outline the roles and responsibilities throughout the data flow process, ensuring that adequate quality assurance mechanisms and procedures are in place. Following a pilot phase, the team is expected to go live with DHIS2 on June 1st."
